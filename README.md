# LIBSVM model evaluator user-interface

While [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) and [LIBLINEAR](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/)
provide a convenient way to work with [support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) on
large datasets, evaluating the output is restricted to an accuracy indicator. This tells something, but often more insight
would be quite useful - a [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) comes to mind, for example.

This project provides a web-based user-interface for diving into LIBSVM files, and browsing through them, with the aim of
understanding the training output.

**currently work in progress**

## todo

- show item details in category overview
- publish tool to create confusion matrix file
- publish example for training and generation
- include example data
- expand README
- allow loading of remote urls
- allow browsing and loading of local files
- remember file history
